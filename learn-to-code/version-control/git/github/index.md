[GitHub](https://github.com/) “is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code...providing the distributed version control of Git”. Using Git and GitHub together, a developer can update their code, track changes, create issues, build deployment workflows, and review and accept changes to their code from developers around the world.

## git vs. github

Git is software that runs locally on your computer.  It is possible to use Git to track changes in local code repositories on your computer without ever creating a GitHub account, or any other Git host account.

GitHub is a remote host and social development platform for code being managed with Git version control. With the proper configuration, we can use Git to sync code changes between the local repositories on our computer and the remote repositories hosted on GitHub's servers, accessible through the GitHub website.
