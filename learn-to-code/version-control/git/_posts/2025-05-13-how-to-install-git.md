[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control software that allows us to save and restore different versions of our files at various points. It is a powerful tool that allows us to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage our codebase effectively.

We have a few options for installing Git, and those options change depending on the operating system you are using.  In this tutorial, I will walk you through the installation process for Windows and MacOS.  If you are using Linux, you can find download instructions for your specific distribution on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux).
