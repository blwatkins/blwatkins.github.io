A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computerâ€™s operating system. A Unix shell provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.  The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating sustem to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

There are many Unix shell programs available to developers, including [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).

To access a Unix shell on a Windows machine, [follow these steps to install Git and GitBash]({% post_url learn-to-code/version-control/git/2025-05-13-how-to-install-git %}). GitBash will be your Unix shell CLI application.

To access a Unix shell on a macOS machine, open the Terminal application. You can find the Terminal application in your `Applications` folder on your computer or by searching for "Terminal" in the Spotlight Search.
