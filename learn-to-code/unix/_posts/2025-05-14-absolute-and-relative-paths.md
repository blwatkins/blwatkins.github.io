When specifying the location of files and folders on a computer system, it is important to know the difference between a relative path and an absolute path, and which is most appropriate for your code.

## absolute path

An absolute path is the path to a file or directory from the root of the computer.

On Unix-like systems, absolute paths begin with `/` (e.g. `/Users/username/`).

On Windows systems, absolute paths begin with the drive name (e.g. `C:/Users/username/`).

In a Unix shell CLI (command line interface), you print the absolute path of your working directory with the `pwd` command.
