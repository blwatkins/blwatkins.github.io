A Unix shell provides a text-based user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and it is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

For writing and executing Unix shell commands and scripts, I recommend the following applications.

## command line interface applications

To execute Unix shell commands and scripts, you will need a command line interface (CLI) application. A command line interface is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computerâ€™s operating system.

### windows

If you are working on a Windows machine, I recommend downloading [Git and GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) so you can use GitBash as your CLI.

Additional information about how to install Git can be found in the [git installation guide]({% post_url learn-to-code/version-control/git/2025-05-13-how-to-install-git %}).

### macOS

If you are working on a macOS machine, you can use the Terminal application as your CLI. Additional information about the Terminal application can be found in the [macOS Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/2.14/mac).

## text editors

If you are writing a shell script, I recommend using a text editor that is designed for writing code. Options for text editors can be found in the [text editors guide]({% post_url learn-to-code/tools/text-editors/2025-05-21-text-editors %}).
