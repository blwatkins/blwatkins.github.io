A command line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computerâ€™s operating system. A Unix shell provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems.  The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating sustem to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

There are many Unix shell programs available to developers, including [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).
