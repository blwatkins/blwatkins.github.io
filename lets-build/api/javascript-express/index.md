An API (application programming interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
APIs are commonly used to enable communication between a client (a web or mobile application) and a server hosting the data and functionality that the client needs to access.

In this tutorial series, we will build an API from scratch, step by step, using [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

## what are we building?

This tutorial will walk you through building a Randomness-as-a-Service API, which provides random numbers, random strings, random booleans, random colors, random books, and other data via HTTP requests.
This API is meant to be a fun way to learn about building APIs while also examining concepts related to randomness and data generation across various domains.

## what will you need?

You will need the following to follow along with this series:

- A computer with internet access and a web browser.
- A code or text editor. Additional information about text editors can be found in the [text editors guide]({% post_url learn-to-code/tools/text-editors/2025-05-21-text-editors %}).
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) JavaScript runtime environment installed on your computer.

## what you should already know

This tutorial is beginner-friendly, but it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of the following concepts before starting:

- Basic programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and control flow.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
- Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub for version control and code hosting.

## additional considerations

### Educational Use

This tutorial series is designed for educational purposes.
The focus of this series is on learning and understanding the concepts and techniques involved in building an API using JavaScript and Express.
The API we will build is not production-ready without additional security and reliability considerations; it is not intended for commercial use.

### GitHub Source Code

Part of this series will involve creating a public GitHub repository to host the code for the API.
If you are not comfortable with this, you can choose to follow along without creating a public repository, or you can use a private GitHub repository.

### Deployment

We'll also deploy the API to a hosting service so that it can be accessed over the internet.
If you are not comfortable with this, you can choose to follow along without deploying the API, or you can deploy it to a local server on your computer.
Deploying the API to a public hosting service is optional and not required to complete the tutorial, but may incur costs depending on the hosting service and accompanying products you choose.
