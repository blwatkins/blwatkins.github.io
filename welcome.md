# welcome, from brittni

Hello! I’m brittni!
I am a software engineer and generative artist, and I absolutely love programming!
I love writing code.
I love refactoring code.
I love fixing bugs in code even when I spend an hour looking for a rogue semi-colon.

There is so much I want to learn and explore, and I’m inviting you to learn and explore with me!
Sometimes, we’ll be learning, sometime’s we’ll be building, sometime’s we’ll be fixing,
and sometimes the code still won’t work, so we’ll need to take break.

Don’t know how to code?
That is perfectly fine!
If you want to learn, feel free to explore and ask questions!
Don’t want to learn? That’s okay too!
I hope you have a great time enjoying the awesome things my code produces.

I’m super excited to share this with you.
I hope you’re able to have fun, learn something new,
and maybe get a new appreciation for the software development process and generative art.
